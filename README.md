safehouse-launcher
==================

A quick script that gets Heroku [Safehouse](https://github.com/hwayne/safehouse) instances up and running really quickly

To use: `launcher NAME_OF_PERSON NUMBER_OF_PERSON`, requires `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` and `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` to be environmental variables

You must have the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) Installed.
